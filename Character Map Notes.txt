The first character map is at 0x7DB20 of the main executable.
The second character map is at 0x80850 of the main executable.

Since it's easier to just use the characters already in the BIOS,
which are mapped in RAM during runtime anyway, we can simply
load those glyphs to the text buffer instead.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll make the game print ASCII instead.

Let's summarize how the game prints text as-is:
It reads a 2-byte Shift-JIS value.
It finds where in RAM this is situated.
It converts it to the format the game understands.
It copies to the buffer.
It prints.
It increments counters, and proceeds to the next character.

Instead, we'll do the following:
Read one byte.
If it's 0x00, we stop, just like the game does already. It's a NUL character.
If it's 0x01 through 0x09 or so, we treat those as control codes.
We ignore everything up to 0x1F inclusive.
0x20 is a space, so we use a particular spot in RAM for a space.
For the rest up until 0x7F inclusive, we use their ASCII equivalents.
For the rest up until 0xFF inclusive, mojibake will be printed, but it doesn't matter.
Repeat from the top.

The result will be a fixed-width ASCII, with double the characters being printable.

We'll need to account for all the times where the game stores and reads a word (2 bytes),
and replace them with byte reads.

The BIOS copy of the ASCII character map is at 0x1FC7F8DE (or 0xBFC7F8DE, if https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/kernelbios/#bios-memory-map is correct)
When copied to RAM, the font should end up at 0x8007F8DE.
For 16x14 glyphs, the game flips endianess of each byte, and prints it to the buffer.
Each 8 bytes is a line (16 1bpp pixels).
For 8x15, we'll have to do 4 bytes, and skip the next 4 every time.
There's enough of a gap between lines that won't make the change in height that noticeable.
However, we will have to start copying 0x8 bytes earlier to the framebuffer, to account for the height difference.
